This project is still a work-in-progress. Data can be freely used, but may be incorrect.

# Boxbox Dungeon Simulator
Simulating winrates for the Boxbox discord server "dungeons" game

Uses [manually collected data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NIThIrcgI00mKHmzBkO9HjSx3BKdprqhsu35EWmfxPY), as the actual source code of Boxbox Dungeons is unknown.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome.

Ask `Zethorix#1064` on Discord if you have any feature requests or would like to contribute in some way that is not listed.

### Data Collection
The easiest way to help is to record a dungeon run and DM it to `Zethorix#1064` on Discord. If you do end up recording for this purpose, make sure to always send it, even if you lose or if the dungeon run was uneventful. Also, if a recording of a dungeon run was not recorded for this purpose, do NOT send the recording just because something unlikely happened. This will skew the data and lead to incorrect results.

If you decide to send a recording, confirm with your teammates, and also make sure that that dungeon run is only being submit once. If you would like, each team member's items entering the run would also be appreciated.

These are the dungeons we need more data for, in order of necessity:
1. Dungeon 8, 9, 10 (Any waves)
2. Dungeon 5 (Wave 1 with multiple party members, Wave 3)
3. Dungeon 3 (Wave 2)
4. Dungeon 6 (Wave 1)
5. Dungeon 0, 1, 2, 4, 7

We also need data for player compositions:
- A team of 2 more with at least one player equipping more than one blocking item (Healing Pendant, Magic Parasol, Survival Kit).
- A team with more than one player equipping blocking items.
- A team with at least one player equipping Rough Skin.
- A team of 2 more with at least one player equipping blocking items and another teammate with the same max HP as that player.
