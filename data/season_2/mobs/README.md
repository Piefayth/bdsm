# Completeness
Data here are not necessarily complete. There could be a mob within a dungeon that has an item not listed if it does not trigger 100% of the time. For example, a mob could have a Magic Parasol that is not listed.

# Correctness
All deterministic data that is stated is correct, including tiers of items that have a distinguishing feature.

The items with nondeterministic tier (and therefore may be incorrect) are:
- Big Club
- Fire Sword
- Magic Parasol
- Survival Kit
- Whirlwind Axe

For these items, accompanying data is provided under the `_stats` parameter. The data here is only for reference and is not used in the code. The more data points there are, the more confident the corresponding tier is.
